                                <span lang="en-US">The act of recognizing when a rule can be applied is to identify
                                    a subgraph within the host that matches with the graph depicted as the left hand
                                    side of the rule (as shown in Figure 1). Within a label rich system, the number
                                    of possible subgraphs reduces drastically. The labels within both the graph L and
                                    graph H in Figure 1 constrain the recognition to a single subgraph (node 2 and arc
                                    10). However, if all of the labels are removed in L, then there are 16 possible
                                    subgraphs. The corollary that is adopted here is that the act of matching a node
                                    or arc to one in the host is that the labels must be a subset. In the case of Figure
                                    1, the subgraph is recognized even though the matching location contains more labels
                                    than L.</span></p>

                                <span lang="en-US">For creative systems, rules are likely constructed to model or contain
                                    particular heuristics or design rules. A label rich recognition like this can be
                                    interpreted as, “if a state of the design contains all the characteristics of a
                                    particular rule, then that rule is applicable.” However, there are cases when rules
                                    may not be easily represented by subsets of labels. It is for this reason that we
                                    additionally equip each node and arc within the left hand side graphs with a Boolean,
                                </span><span lang="en-US" style='font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 121%; font-family: "Trebuchet MS";

                                        lang="en-US">. If this Boolean is set to true then we enforce that the set of labels
                                        must be identical in both rule and host. In this case, the rule shown in Figure
                                        1 will not be recognized within the host. If all the labels were removed in the
                                        L graph, we would find only one location (node 5 and arc 14) as opposed to the 16
                                        discussed above.</span></p>

                                <span lang="en-US">It is clear from this example that by setting the label matching
                                    as “equal to” as opposed to subset, the number of recognized location reduces significantly.
                                    In addition to this restriction, there are number of additional Booleans that can
                                    be implemented to better capture the intended rule recognitions. For each node,
                                    one can limit the number of arcs that are connected to it. In our implementation,

                                                    that are properly matched (node 1 and arc 8, and node 6 and arc 12).</span></p>

                                            false, we assume that undirected arcs can be matched with directed arcs or doubly-directed
                                            arcs in the host. When set to true, the Boolean limits matching undirected only
                                            with undirected, directed only with other directed with the same sense, and doubly-directed
                                            with doubly-directed. An additional Boolean related to arcs deals with handling
                                            the dangling nature of arcs. The L in Figure 1, only includes a single node and
                                            arc; however, many approaches to graph theory disallow arcs from having an unspecified
                                            or dangling end. In the development of the methodology and implementation presented
                                            here, both cases are handled. In the examples that have played out from Figure 3,
                                            the missing node at the bottom of L is treated as a wildcard that matches with any
                                            node regardless of its characteristics. If one creates a rule that seeks to match
                                            an arc to a similar dangling arcs in the host, then the Boolean, </span>

                                <span lang="en-US">can be set to true for the arc. This prevent this from matching with
                                    arcs that are defined between two nodes. In the example, this Boolean set to true
                                    would again prevent the rule from recognizing a legitimate subgraph with the host.</span></p>

                                <span lang="en-US">Finally, the subgraph recognition ambiguities can result in the graph-wide

                                                contains all the nodes of the host graph but not necessarily all the arcs. Clearly,
                                                this results in no recognition in the previous example. When the induced Boolean
                                                is set to true the subgraph is required to be an induced subgraph within the host.
                                                This means that L must contain all arcs that exist between the recognized nodes
                                                in the host. These subgraph Booleans are commonly accepted as fundamental to graph
                                                theory. Graphs can also have labels similar to those in the nodes and arcs. As a
                                                result, we create a final Boolean that relates to the global labels being a proper
                                                subset or equivalent to those in the host. A final summary of these subgraph Booleans
                                                are shown in Table 1. While some of these have existed before in past graph theory
                                                literature, we have expanded the set to include all possible ambiguities in what
                                                is meant by subgraph. Since a graph can be defined in category theory as an interacting
                                                set of sets (e.g. set of labels, sets of arcs, and sets of nodes) the Booleans allow
                                                us to independently define how the subsets are determined for each of these components.</span></p>

                                    L of a rule, and the host graph. What is expected as a result is a list of subgraphs
                                    where L is found in the host. For a particular rule and host, there may be no subgraph,

                                <span lang="en-US">The approach developed in our implementation is a recursive search
                                    starting with a single node in L. The first node in L is checked to see if it matches
                                    with each of the nodes in the host. For those in which it is a successful match,
                                    a modified depth-first-search (DFS) is invoked from each matching node within the
                                    host. As creators of the grammar rules, one can impact the efficiency of the recognition
                                    process by altering the order in which the nodes are presented. The computational
                                    structure for a graph stores the set of nodes as a list; by placing the most restrictive
                                    node (the node that is hardest to match) first in the list of nodes one can eliminate
                                    wasted search that would occur if a less restricted node is presented first. An
                                    example of this is shown in Figure 2. The node I in L is more restrictive than node
                                    III and the order of expansion is shown in Figure 2a and b. The depth-first-search
                                    proves to be a more efficient approach to recognition both in computational speed
                                    and memory.</span></p>

                                    requires that we uniquely match each node and arc to one in the host. This becomes
                                    more apparent in the discussion of rule application since the rule essentially includes
