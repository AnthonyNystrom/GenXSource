<h1>Edit Functions</h1>
<img src="FunctionForm.png"><br>
<br>
In the textbox at the top you can enter a name for the function. If a legend is displayed, this name appears in the legend. The name also appears in the edit menu, so you can change the functions properties.<br>
Below you can change the functions drawing attributes. You can change the graphs color by pressing the <b>Color...</b> button, or you can change the line style and the line width in the appropriate controls. If your function is a two dimensional function you can further choose the color palette with which the function is displayed. If you check the <b>RGB</b> checkbox, a Red-Green-Blue palette is used to draw the function. If the checkbox is not checked, a monochrome palette will be used, using the color set by the <b>Color...</b> button.<br>
Below the drawing attributes you can select the type of your function. You can choose between a one dimensional, two dimensional and a color function. The one and two dimensional function types represent a function in one or two variables, that return a double value. The color function type is a function in two variables that returns a color.<br>
Below the function type is some text that shows the headers of the C# source text of the function. This text varies according to the function type. In addition to the bare function, there are two <code>double[]</code> arrays defined, <code>p</code> and <code>dfdp</code>.
The array <code>p</code> is an array of parameters your function depends on. You can edit the parameters by pressing the <b>Parameters (p)...</b> button. This will show a <a href="ParForm.html">dialogbox</a> for editing the parameters. <a name="derivativeinfo">If you want to do Levenberg-Marquardt fitting with your function you might want to also supply the derivative information, e.g. the derivatives of df/dp.</a> If you omit the derivative information in your function, the Levenberg-Marquardt fit algortihm will use numerically calcualted derivatives and will require more function evaluations. There is also another fit algorithm called Nelder & Mead that requires no derivative information. Here is an example of a straight line with derivative information:
<pre>
  dfdp[0] = 1; dfdp[1] = x;
  return p[0] + x*p[1];
</pre>

Here is an example of a gauss curve with derivative information:
<pre>
  double arg, ex, fac;
  arg = (x - p[1]/p[2]);
  ex = Math.Exp(-arg*arg);
  fac = p[0]*ex*2*arg;
  dfdp[0] = ex;
  dfdp[1] = fac/p[2];
  dfdp[2] = fac*arg/p[2];
  return p[0]*ex;
</pre>

Here is an example for a two dimensional function that will draw the Mandelbrot set:
<pre>
  double xn = 0, yn = 0, x2 = 0, y2 = 0;
  for (int n = 0; n < 500; n++) {
    yn = 2*xn*yn + y;
    xn = x2 - y2 + x;
    x2 = xn*xn;
    y2 = yn*yn;
    if (x2 + y2 > 4) return n;
  }
  return 0;
</pre>

If you have entered your functions C# sourcecode, you can press the <b>Compile</b> button to check for syntax errors.<br>
If you are finished you can press the <b>Ok</b> button. If you want to delete the function, you press the <b>Delete</b> button.
