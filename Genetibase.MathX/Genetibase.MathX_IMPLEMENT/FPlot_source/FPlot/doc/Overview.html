<h1>Welcome</h1>
Welcome to FPlot, a .NET programm for displaying mathematical functions and measurement data. Why yet another function plotting programm? The great advantage of FPlot is speed. Functions can be entered as C# sourcecode and compiled on the fly with the C#-compiler included in .NET.  This way your functions evaluate at the full speed of any compiled .NET programm. There is no slow expression interpreter in between. Because of this, you can use complicated numerical algorithms in your functions, with only a moderate speed penalty to C/C++ or Fortran. If you use sophisticated numerical libraries there is almost no speed penalty compared to C code. Altough I don't know of any freeware .NET numerical library around there are some good comercial packages. You can use those libraries in your functions and can do complicated numerical calculations. Check out <a href="http://www.centerspace.net">CenterSpace Softare</a> or <a href="http://www.vni.com/products/imsl/cSharp/overview.html">Visual Numerics</a> for commercial numerical .NET libraries. As an addition to this, the main control that plots the functions and measurement data is located in a separate dll you can freely reuse in your own .NET programms. The documentation for this library is found in the directory where you installed FPlot in the help folder. This library comes with the complete sourcecode. You can freely modify this code and include it in your own programms. The source-code of the FPlot application is not yet available for free, because it uses some routines from Numerical Recipes and therefore cannot be published freely. Maybe in the future I will replace the Numerical Recipes routines with freeware ones, so the complete sourcecode of the FPlot package can be published.
