	/// <summary>
	/// Creates math transforms.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>IMathTransformFactory is a low level factory that is used to create
	/// IMathTransform objects.  Many high level GIS applications will never
	/// need to use a IMathTransformFactory directly; they can use a
	/// ICoordinateTransformationFactory instead.  However, the
	/// IMathTransformFactory interface is specified here, since it can be
	/// used directly by applications that wish to transform other types of
	/// coordinates (e.g. color coordinates, or image pixel coordinates).</para>
	///
	/// <para>The following comments assume that the same vendor implements the math
	/// transform factory interfaces and math transform interfaces.</para>
	///
	/// <para>A math transform is an object that actually does the work of applying
	/// formulae to coordinate values.  The math transform does not know or
	/// care how the coordinates relate to positions in the real world.  This
	/// lack of semantics makes implementing IMathTransformFactory significantly
	/// easier than it would be otherwise.</para>
	///
	/// <para>For example IMathTransformFactory can create affine math transforms.  The
	/// affine transform applies a matrix to the coordinates without knowing how
	/// what it is doing relates to the real world.  So if the matrix scales Z
	/// values by a factor of 1000, then it could be converting meters into
	/// millimeters, or it could be converting kilometers into meters.</para>
	///
	/// <para>Because math transforms have low semantic value (but high mathematical
	/// value), programmers who do not have much knowledge of how GIS applications
	/// use coordinate systems, or how those coordinate systems relate to the real
	/// world can implement IMathTransformFactory.</para>
	///
	/// <para>The low semantic content of math transforms also means that they will be
	/// useful in applications that have nothing to do with GIS coordinates.  For
	/// example, a math transform could be used to map color coordinates between
	/// different color spaces, such as converting (red, green, blue) colors into
	/// (hue, light, saturation) colors.</para>
	/// 
	/// <para>Since a math transform does not know what its source and target coordinate
	/// systems mean, it is not necessary or desirable for a math transform object
	/// to keep information on its source and target coordinate systems.</para>
	/// </remarks>
