	/// <summary>
	/// Implements the Mercator projection.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>This map projection introduced in 1569 by Gerardus Mercator. It is often described as a cylindrical projection,
	/// but it must be derived mathematically. The meridians are equally spaced, parallel vertical lines, and the
	/// parallels of latitude are parallel, horizontal straight lines, spaced farther and farther apart as their distance
	/// from the Equator increases. This projection is widely used for navigation charts, because any straight line
	/// on a Mercator-projection map is a line of constant true bearing that enables a navigator to plot a straight-line
	/// course. It is less practical for world maps because the scale is distorted; areas farther away from the equator
	/// appear disproportionately large. On a Mercator projection, for example, the landmass of Greenland appears to be
	/// greater than that of the continent of South America; in actual area, Greenland is smaller than the Arabian Peninsula.
	/// </para>
