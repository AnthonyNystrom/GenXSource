	///<remarks>
	///<para>A coordinate system is a mathematical space, where the elements of
	///the space are called positions.  Each position is described by a list
	///of numbers.  The length of the list corresponds to the dimension of
	///the coordinate system.  So in a 2D coordinate system each position is
	///described by a list containing 2 numbers.</para>
	///
	///<para>However, in a coordinate system, not all lists of numbers correspond
	///to a position - some lists may be outside the domain of the coordinate
	///system.  For example, in a 2D Lat/Lon coordinate system, the list (91,91)
	///does not correspond to a position.</para>
	///
	///<para>Some coordinate systems also have a mapping from the mathematical space
	///into locations in the real world.  So in a Lat/Lon coordinate system, the
	///mathematical position (lat, long) corresponds to a location on the surface
	///of the Earth.  This mapping from the mathematical space into real-world
	///locations is called a Datum.</para>

		/// (-180,-90) to (180,90), and a geocentric coordinate system could return
