	/// <summary>
	/// A local coordinate system, with uncertain relationship to the world (Not implemented);
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// In general, a local coordinate system cannot be related to other coordinate systems. However, if two objects supporting this interface have the same dimension, axes, units and datum then client code is permitted to assume that the two coordinate systems are identical. This allows several datasets from a common source (e.g. a CAD system) to be overlaid. In addition, some implementations of the Coordinate Transformation (CT) package may have a mechanism for correlating local datums. (E.g. from a database of transformations, which is created and maintained from real-world measurements.)
