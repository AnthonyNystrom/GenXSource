    <h1 align="center"><strong>The Marching Cubes Algorithm</strong></h1>
    <p align="right"><strong>By James Sharman</strong></p>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Computer rendering techniques have always concentrated on
    visualising simple primitive structures, more complex
    structures can then be created by combining these simple
    'primitives' to shape a more complex model. Unfortunately the
    real world has never been very forgiving and some types of
    data do not translate very easily. The Marching Cubes
    algorithm was designed by William E. Lorensen and Harvey E.
    Cline to extract surface information from a 3d field of
    values. The input data set can represent anything from
    medical imaging data to geological scans.</p>
    <p>This is also a very graphically intensive page you may
    have to wait a short while for all images to load. While you
    are waiting you might want to take a quick look at the
    following related references from the <a href="http://www.exaflop.org/docs/cgafaq/">Comp.Graphics.Algorithms

            is the status of the patent on the "marching
            cubes" algorithm?</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Input Data</h3>
    <p>For the Marching Cubes algorithm to work we need to
    provide some basic information, the main question we will
    need to ask of out data in order to reconstruct the surface
    is "Is the point at &lt;X,Y,Z&gt; inside or outside of
    the object?". In order to produce test code we need some
    sample data and preferably another way of visualising the
    data for comparison. Appropriate test data has been selected
    and the graphical representation of its original form is
    shown bellow. If you want to know more about the actual test
    data and the reason for its selection then read the section
    on "<a href="#The%20Test%20Data">The Test Data</a>" a
    the end of the document.</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="index_files/mc_blobs.gif" height="256" width="256"></p>
    <h3 align="left">The Basic Principle</h3>
    <p align="left">The basic principle behind the marching cubes
    algorithm is to subdivide space into a series of small cubes.
    The algorithm then instructs us to 'march' through each of
    the cubes testing the corner points and replacing the cube
    with an appropriate set of polygons. The sum total of all
    polygons generated will be a surface that <u>approximates</u>
    the one the data set describes. </p>
    <p align="left">To explain the algorithm let us first look at
    a 2 dimensional equivalent. The diagram bellow on the left
    shows a grid of squares equivalent to the cubes from the 3d
    algorithm (many people refer to the cubes as 'cells' or
    voxels). A solid circle has been drawn which is the shape we
    are going to approximate using lines (instead of polygons).</p>
    <p align="left">The first step is to calculate the corners
    that are inside the shape (represented by the green dots). We
    can now insert some vertices, since we know which points are
    inside and which are outside we can guess that a vertex
    should be positioned approximately halfway between an inside
    corner and any outside corners that are connected by the edge
    of a cell. The central diagram bellow shows the discussed
    vertices as small red dots and the diagram on the right shows
    the matching surface formed by joining the vertices with
    lines.</p>
    <div align="center"><center><table border="0">
        <tbody><tr>
            <td align="center" width="165"><img src="index_files/mc1.gif" align="left" height="154" hspace="0" width="158"></td>
            <td align="center" width="165"><img src="index_files/mc2.gif" height="154" width="158"></td>
            <td align="center" width="165"><img src="index_files/mc3.gif" align="right" height="154" hspace="0" width="158"></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody></table>
    </center></div><p align="left">We can see that the resulting
    surface has given us a fairly decent representation of the
    circle, unfortunately we can also see that the shape suffers
    from some kind of spatial aliasing, we shall look at ways of
    dealing with this later.</p>
    <h3 align="left">Working In 3D</h3>
    <p align="left">Now we understand the basic principle we can
    go on to look at how the principle can be made to work in 3
    dimensions. We are now of course dealing with cube's that
    have 8 corners and therefore a potential 256 possible
    combinations of corner status. However to simplify the
    algorithm we can reduce the complexity by taking into account
    cell combinations that duplicate under the following
    conditions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Rotation by any degree over any of the 3 primary axis</li>
        <li>Mirroring the shape across any of the 3 primary axis </li>
        <li>Inverting the state of all corners and flipping the
            normals of the relating polygons. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Taking this into account we can resolve the original 256
    combinations of cell state down to a total of 15
    combinations, with this number it is then easy to create
    predefined polygon sets for making the appropriate surface
    approximation. The image bellow gives an example data set
    covering all of the 15 possible combinations. The blue
    spheres denote corners that have tested as inside the shape
    and the green arrows denote the surface normals of the
    relevant triangles.</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="index_files/cubes1.gif" height="277" width="447"></p>
    <h3 align="left">Implementation</h3>
    <p align="left">We now have all of the basic information we
    need to reconstruct the surface apart from the sample
    density. The Sample density is essentially the number of
    cubes along each axis we intend to divide the volume into,
    this relates directly to the output quality. Since our test
    object occupies a roughly cube shaped volume of space this
    will be the same dumber of divisions along each axis. Bellow
    are some sample outputs from the algorithm at 12,20 and 50
    subdivisions, this is equal to 1728, 8000 and 125000 cells
    respectively. </p>
    <p align="center"><img src="index_files/mc_blobs_12.gif" height="256" width="256"><img src="index_files/mc_blobs_20.gif" height="256" width="256"><img src="index_files/mc_blobs_50.gif" height="256" width="256"></p>
    <h3 align="left">Analysis Of The Results</h3>
    <p align="left">Immediately we can see the approximate shape
    of our test shape even at the lowest sampling frequency, at
    the top end we can see quite a bit of detail. Unfortunately
    we are also seeing the same kind of spatial aliasing as we
    saw in the 2D example, however this has shown us that the
    algorithm is working properly. The results are not however as
    good as we would like, it is now time to look beyond the
    basic algorithm at ways to improve the quality of the
    reconstructed surface.</p>
    <h3 align="left">Possible Methods For Improvement</h3>
    <p align="left">We could at any stage apply conventional
    smoothing to the mesh, this would of course improve the look
    but what is more important at this stage is to improve the
    accuracy of the surface. If we look back at our original 2D
    test we can see that many of the assumed vertices are a
    significant distance from the actual surface. Since we know
    that all the vertices are on an edge between a corner known
    to be inside the shape and a corner known to be outside the
    shape we can move the vertex along this edge to the actual
    surface point. This extension to the algorithm is referred to
    as "Adaptive Marching Cubes". The Diagrams bellow
    show our 2D example with the new vertex positions and with
    the new surface, a far better fit.</p>
    <div align="center"><center><table border="0">
        <tbody><tr>
            <td width="165"><img src="index_files/mca1.gif" height="154" width="158"></td>
            <td width="165"><img src="index_files/mca2.gif" align="right" height="154" hspace="0" width="158"></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody></table>
    </center></div><h3 align="left">Implementation Considerations</h3>
    <p align="left">There are two main methods we can use to
    calculate the new vertex positions for our 3D mesh, we can
    either do it mathematically or by successive approximation.
    We can only perform this operation mathematically if we have
    at least some understanding of the structure we are
    representing, if we can only determine if a point lies inside
    or outside the shape this is not going to help. If however we
    have a good understanding of the maths involved we can
    directly calculate the new vertex position, this is normally
    the case when the structure is represented as a field of
    values where the surface is defined by a threshold, if for
    example, given corner on our circle we can return the
    distance from the centre, the threshold would then be the
    radios of the circle. It is not necessary to go into the
    maths necessary to do this since it can differ from model to
    model, for a more generic approach consider the use of
    successive approximation.</p>
    <p align="left">Successive approximation has the advantage
    that we don't need to no anything else about the model, we
    still only need to be able to ask the question is point
    &lt;x,y,z&gt; inside or outside of the shape? Since we know
    that one of the ends of the edge is inside the shape and one
    is outside we can check an additional point between those
    two, we should now have a region half the size in which we
    know the surface resides. Repeating this process recursively
    only a few more times gives a very accurate result.</p>
    <p align="left">The two images bellow show the output of the
    algorithm with the adaptive extensions, as you can see the
    reconstructed surface is a lot more convincing and follows
    the contours of the original shape far better.</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="index_files/mc_blobs_12a.gif" height="256" width="256"><img src="index_files/mc_blobs_20a.gif" height="256" width="256"></p>
    <h3 align="left">Conclusion</h3>
    <p align="left">As we can see the adaptive algorithm has
    produced a very close approximation to the original surface,
    if we were to add conventional smoothing to this polygons we
    would have an image that is near perfect at only 20
    subdivisions. There are other ways of extending this
    algorithm that will be discussed in later documents although
    the marching cubes algorithm does suffer from its fixed
    subdivision of space. In later documents we will also go on
    to look at methods that involve non regular spatial
    subdivisions to improve the accuracy of the resulting image
    without such high polygon counts.</p>
    <h3 align="left"><a name="The Test Data" id="The Test Data">The Test Data</a></h3>
    <p align="left">For those who are interested this section
    describes what the test data was along with the platform I
    used to draw the results. It was important to be able to
    produce direct comparisons between the original data and the
    results in order to establish the accuracy of the algorithm
    (and the robustness of the test implementation). The Freeware
    raytracing package POVRAY includes primitives to ray-trace
    'Blobs', any given blob can be defined by the expression:</p>
    <p align="center"><sup><strong><img src="index_files/mc_eq1.gif" height="64" width="226"></strong></sup></p>
    <p align="left">The surface of the shape is defined as where
    the sum total of power influence exerted by all the blobs in
    the shape is equal to a given threshold value. If you want to
    know more about blobs then visit <a href="http://www.povray.org/" target="_blank">www.povray.org</a> and download
    the source code, then examine the file blob.c (there are some
    good explanations in the comments). The main benefits of
    using POVRAY blobs as the test data was that it was very easy
    to produce a comparatively complex shape and we had a ready
    made platform for producing a near perfect visualisation of
    the original data. The various images testing different
    configurations were also rendered using POVRAY (but this time
    with the triangle primitive), this allowed us to guarantee
    that the images were drawn under exactly the same conditions
    (Scale,Surface Properties,Camera model and Illumination) with
    only the actual surface changing. The end result was a
    perfect set of images for comparing the output of the
    algorithm.</p>
