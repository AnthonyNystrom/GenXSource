    <p>Textured spheres allow for perlin generated textures to be used for diffuse colour
       and normal map. The normal map is used for lighting, the height can be used for alpha
       based bloom brightness pass.</p>
    <p>This effect needs to be alpha enabled so that it can be blended over electron orbitals.</p>
