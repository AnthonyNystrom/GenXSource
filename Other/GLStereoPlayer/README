GLStereoPlayer is an OpenGL-based stereoscopic movie and image viewer application.

It supports various input file formats via Microsoft DirectShow and Developer's Image
Library (DevIL) libraries, and popular stereo rendering types including anagryph,
horizontally and vertically split, interlaced, Sharp3D and quad buffer.

GLStereoPlayer uses Microsoft DirectShow and Developer's Image Library (DevIL),
so it supports various input file formats.  You can load two separate sources
for stereoscopic rendering, and you can also load a single source which
combines the two sources horizontally or vertically.  It also supports various
stereoscopic rendering types such as anagryph, horizontal and vertical split,
interlaced, Sharp3D  and quad buffer stereo.  So you need only a single
content file for multiple types of stereoscopic hardware.

GLStereoPlayer is consist of three programs.

GLStereoPlayer.exe is a standalone viewer program.  It's easy to use,
and it shows all what the GLStereoPlayer can do.

GLSPCtrl.ocx is an ActiveX version of the GLStereoPlayer.  It realizes
stereoscopic rendering inside other programs such as PowerPoint.
With a GeoWall type stereoscopic hardware and a professional guraphic card
which supports quad-buffer/clone-mode stereo, you can show a stereoscopic
presentation!

glutStereoPlayer.exe is a simple viewer program based on GLUT library.
If you are a 3d graphics programmer, you can easily understand its source,
and get understand how to integrate the GLStereoPlayer functionalities
in your software.  GLStereoPlayer is also a good example to implement
a movie texture in your OpenGL based software.  Hack the source!!

This library is distributed under GNU LGPL version 2, which can be
found in the file  "COPYING".
