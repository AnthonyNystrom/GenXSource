Version 0.6.0

* I know you need a detail documents...

* Localization.  Almost all the string resources are strings.rc file,
  maintain this file and translate it into different languages.
  Then make a dll file named localize.dll and put the same directory as
  GLStereoPlayer.exe and GLSPCtrl.ocx.

* ActiveX version stores the file path only as an absolute file path.
  Because it's difficult for ActiveX component to know its client enough,
  we can't determine the relative source file path via the clients' document file path.
  So if you use the GLStereoPlayer in PowerPoint, don't move the movie and image file,
  or keep the same absolute file path in different environment.

* Use a shader for fast gray scale conversion in Anagryph rendering.

* In PowerPoint, each ActiveX instance is loaded on RAM, and there are no way
  to know whether if it is shown or hidden. So each ActiveX instance can't unload
  movie or image data, and it consumes lots of memory...

* Implement CGLStereoPlayerCtrl::OnDrawMetafile to draw the captured image.
