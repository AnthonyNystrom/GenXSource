To Chris:

This assembly is an addin of the Cobalt IDE and serves only to show you how one can integrate complete applications in Cobalt and
use the diagramming control without having to re-invent a whole architecture.

I have taken your Yttrium demo and copied the controls, together with a bit of glueing and matching.

Hope you like it!
