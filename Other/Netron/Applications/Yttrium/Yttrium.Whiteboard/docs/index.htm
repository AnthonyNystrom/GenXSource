        <h2>
            Math.NET Symbolics: Yttrium - Package Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Yttrium is an experimental computer algebra architecture, implementing ideas and
            concepts of formal hardware engineering and digital information engineering, looking
            at abstract math and algebra from a different, new angle.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yttrium is connected to the other new Math.NET packages like <a href="http://www.cdrnet.net/projects/nmath/numerics/">
                Numerics</a>, PreciseNumerics and <a href="http://www.cdrnet.net/projects/nmath/signalprocessing/">
                    SignalProcessing</a>, and thus takes direct advantage of the optimized numerical
            routines.</p>
        <h3>
            What's coming, current development</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="http://dev.cdrnet.net/cs/blogs/mathnet_en/default.aspx">Math.NET Project News
                Blog</a> with current ideas, thoughts and developments around the Math.NET project.

        <h4>
            Complete the Core Architecture</h4>
        <p>
            Most of the Yttrium Core are designed and work fine, the rest es being completed,
            simplified and optimized.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Extending the Standard Library</h4>
        <p>
            The standard library (automatically loaded) covers basic data structures like integers,
            floating point numbers, modular rings as well as logic states. Additionally there
            are architectures for elementary operations of topics like logic, arithmetic, algebra
            and analysis/calculus. It's not certain yet whether topics like linear algebra or
            probability theory and models will be included into the standard library or (more
            likely) will be offered in seperate modules.</p>
        <h4>
            User Interface
        </h4>
        <p>
            Math.NET is a software library to be used in mathematical applications, but is not
            exactly such an end-user application. Nevertheless, Yttrium will provide several
            user interfaces just like Classic did. One of those is already working: a graphical
            frontend based on the Netron Graph Library.</p>
