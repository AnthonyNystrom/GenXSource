					<a name="2_1"></a>
					<h3 class="bottomSpace">2.1 What is Live Streaming Video?</h3>
					<p>
						With Next2friends Live Streaming Video, you can broadcast live events from any capable mobile device or 
						webcam to your family and friends wherever they are in the world! They can watch any event in real-time 
						with you, as it happens!
					</p>
					<p>
						And if multiple people are at the same event and broadcast on the same channel, any number of end users 
						will be able to choose between the different camera angles being streamed to edit, download or even 
						burn a DVD of the event. Next2Friends Live Video Streaming means no one ever has to miss that first 
						home run again, or that all of us can be eye-witnesses to life changing events anytime, from anywhere!

					<p>
						Next2Friends Live Streaming Video support for mobile devices running Windows Mobile 6 will begin 
						early March, 2008.  Live Streaming Video will be possible with Apple’s iPhone roughly 45 days 
						after the release of their Software Developer’s Kit.  This is rumored to be sometime in February, 
						2008, so you can look for compatibility on the iPhone sometime in April, 2008.

					<hr />
					
					<a name="3_1"></a>
					<h3 class="bottomSpace">3.1  What is Next2Friends Tag?</h3>
					<p>
						Next2Friends Tag is designed to automate the otherwise tedious task of online person-to-person network 
						building by bridging your online profile and the physical “real world”. Here’s how it works:
					</p>
					<p>
						You set up a profile detailing all your likes, your dislikes, your quirks and everything that makes 
						you who you are. Then, if you load Next2Friends onto your mobile device and turn on Proximity Services, 
						Next2Friends will look for other users you come into close proximity with that share your likes, dislikes, 
						and yes, even your quirks. Finally, when you sign into your account you’ll receive notification of all 
						the people you passed throughout the day who you have something in common with. And the rest is up to you!

						<a href="#top">return to top &raquo;</a>
					</p>
					
					<hr />
					
					<a name="3_2"></a>
					<h3 class="bottomSpace">3.2  How does it do that?</h3>
					<p>
						The service uses both Bluetooth and P2P WIFI enabled mobile devices to interact with your online profile 
						and record relative matches to other users you come into close proximity with (within 300 metres).

					<h3 class="bottomSpace">3.3  Can I use Next2Friends Tag with my mobile device?</h3>
					<p>
						Next2Friends Tag can run on <a href="http://www.j2mepolish.org/devices/midp2.html">J2ME (Java) MIDP2</a> enabled mobile device. Just download the Next2Friends

					<h3 class="bottomSpace">3.4  This sounds a little scary, kind of like “Big Brother”!  Will people be able to track my every move?</h3>
					<p>
						 No.  You choose when you want to be “seen”, or rather, when you will be out actively 
						 collecting profile matches.  If you’d like nothing to do with finding matches to your profile 
						 then you can simply disable Next2Friends Tag.

					<h3 class="bottomSpace">3.5  What if someone hacks Next2Friends, will someone, then, be able to track my every move?</h3>
					<p>
						Not bloody likely.  Next2Friends has developed it’s own exclusive patent pending encryption algorithms 
						to ensure your privacy and anonymity.  No one else in the world knows it, no one else in the world ever will.

					<hr />
					
					<a name="4_1"></a>
					<h3 class="bottomSpace">4.1 What is Ask-A-Friend?</h3>
					<p>
						Ask-A-Friend is a dynamic new way to get instant feedback from all your friends, or if you choose, 
						the entire Next2Friends community.  It works like this: You snap photos to create an instant opinion 
						poll to send to whomever you choose for a vote. Your friends will receive notification via their 
						mobile device or their Next2Friends profile that an opinion poll has been created.  They choose 
						their favorites among the pictures and the results are then sent directly back to you. 
						Ask-A-Friend gives you real time results when you need them the most; in the real world!
