To install gSOAP, unpack the archive. You will get the following files:

README.txt	read this first
LICENSE.txt	license information
NOTES.txt	this file
license.html	gSOAP public license (HTML), see LICENSE.txt
license.pdf	gSOAP public license (PDF), see LICENSE.txt
gpl.txt		GPL license, see LICENSE.txt

The 'gsoap' folder contains essential source code for the run-time libraries:

stdsoap2.h	header file for stdsoap2.c[pp]
stdsoap2.c	library and gSOAP runtime
stdsoap2.cpp	library (identical to stdsoap2.c)
dom.c		C DOM parser
dom.cpp		C++ DOM parser

and the following folders:

bin		binaries
doc		documentation, including soapdoc2.html, soapdoc2.pdf
samples		examples
extras		contributed extras
import		#import-ed header files for soapcpp2 compiler
plugin		plug-in examples
custom		custom serializers for various data types
mod_gsoap	contributed Apache mod_gsoap, IIS, and WinInet support
src		gSOAP soapcpp2 compiler sources
wsdl		WSDL parser wsdl2h sources
WS		typemap.dat and WS-* protocol schemas
uddi2		UDDI v2

All examples are available in the 'samples' subdirectory.

The 'gsoap_mod' directory includes Apache 1.x and 2.0 mods for gSOAP, IIS, and
WinInet support. WinInet allows gsoap to use the WinInet API instead of calls
to the socket API. The primary benefit of this arrangement is that "if IE
works, your program will work". There is no need to read proxy settings from
the registry, deal with proxy configuration scripts, etc. Changes in the
"Internet Options" dialog box will immediately take effect in your program.
Additionally, this will allow gsoap to handle forms of authentication not yet
supported natively, such as NTLM (Integrated Windows Authentication), etc.

Contributions are included in the 'extras' directory and 'mod_gsoap'.
