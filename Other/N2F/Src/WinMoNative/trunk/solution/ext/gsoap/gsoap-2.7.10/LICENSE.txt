gSOAP is distributed with a choice of three licenses:

* The gSOAP public open source license (which is based on the Mozilla public
  license 1.1). See license.html or license.pdf for further details.

* Or GPL (GNU Public License, a common open-source software license).
  IMPORTANT: see NOTE below.

* Or a proprietary software development license.
  IMPORTANT: see NOTE below.

You can choose which license applies best for your intended use. The software
is offered under GPL conditions to enable the software to be used with open
source GPL projects, educational use, and so on. We do not accept third-party
GPL contributions to avoid having to fork the code base in GPL and non-GPL.

IMPORTANT NOTE: the wsdl2h parser, UDDI code, and sample applications such as
the stand-alone web server are distributed ONLY under the GPL or the
proprietary license. This means that commercial use of wsdl2h to generate code
for product development, or the use of the UDDI source code, or the use of code
from the sample Web service applications requires the proprietary software
development license. The reason for this is that the wsdl2h tool, UDDI and some
of the sample applications are not developed at Florida State University.
Please contact me by email if you have any questions on licensing and software
support: engelen@genivia.com

The parts of the code that are strictly distributed under the GPL (i.e. the
code that is only distributed under GPL and not jointly under GPL and gSOAP
public license) cannot be used for commercial purposes. These parts are:

* The wsdl2h WSDL parser source code and the code generated by it.

* The UDDI source code.

* The examples included in the gSOAP distribution package 'samples' directory.
