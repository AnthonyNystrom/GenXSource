//
// History:
// --------
//	5/7/2002	1.0.0.0		Initial implementation.	
//
//	5/10/2002 	1.1.0.0		Fix problems with icon and color items. Also fixed problems
//					with expanding columns and column size. Added TAB support, 
//					hit TAB to activate next item, and SHIFT TAB to activate previous item.
//					NOTE: You must commit current item with the ENTER key before tabbing, 
//					this is because some controls use TAB i.e.) edit, control box, radio, and so on.
//
//	5/11/2002	1.1.1.0		Fixed IsWindow() issues, which are the causes for a lot of Win98 problems. 
//					Fixed IDC_HAND problem for non Win 2K or XP users. Fixed some resource and 
//					overhead problems. Also added expand all feature. Huge thanks go out to all 
//					bug reporters, especially YoSilver.
//
//	5/14/2002	1.1.2.0		Fixed icon and color bug. Also added GetItemType() to determine different item types.
//
//	9/1/2002	1.1.2.1		Beta release, beta is not stable by any means.
//
//	9/8/2002	2.0.0.0		The long awaited 2.0 version is here. Fixed a lot of bugs, created more bugs,
//					added several more items, and a lot of other stuff that is way too much to list here.
//					Oh plus I added fancy new version numbers, this I think was the biggest update.
