/**
 * Agent abstract base, for client use with Octree.<br/><br/>
 *
 * Client of Octree must define a concrete derivative of
 * OctreeAgent<ItemType>.<br/><br/>
 *
 * This is similar to a proxy: it is an intermediary for an Octree to query
 * its typeless subject items, when inserting or removing.<br/><br/>
 *
 * The overlap methods are to determine an item's relation to a cell or cells,
 * for insertion or removal. The parameters supply the bounds of the cell.
 * <br/><br/>
 *
 * Return value of getSubcellOverlaps is 8 bits, each bit is a bool
 * corresponding to a subcell, the high bit for subcell 7, the low bit for
 * subcell 0.<br/><br/>
 *
 * Subcell numbering:
 * <pre>
 *    y z       6 7
 *    |/   2 3  4 5
 *     -x  0 1
 * </pre>
 * in binary:
 * <pre>
 *    y z           110 111
 *    |/   010 011  100 101
 *     -x  000 001
 * </pre>
 *
 * @implementation
 * The ___V methods simply apply a type-cast to void*s and forward to their
 * abstract counterparts.<br/><br/>
 *
 * An Octree requires its contained items to provide positional info. But
 * requiring the item classes to implement an OctreeItem interface would
 * impose a direct interface change on every prospective item type, and enlarge
 * their instances with a vptr.<br/><br/>
 *
 * Instead, this agent transfers the Octree-related interface/implementation
 * away from the item type into a separate class. The Octree can now hold void
 * pointers to items and call the agent to query them indirectly.<br/><br/>
