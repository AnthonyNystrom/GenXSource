1. Project out into Octree to determine what 2d-area of rays are needed, by what can be rejected
by looking at the tree nodes
2. Batch these areas into groups by sub-divison of the area(s) (or by nodes??)
3. Project each area into the octree to generate a list of rays and nodes to search in
4. Run each ray through the nodes it has flagged to conclusion
